title: "Updating my text editor"
tags: [opinion, misc]

Text editor is likely the tool where programmers spend the most time,
thus it is vital that the tool of choice is up to the job.

In the core software engineesing classes we had religious battles over which one should use;
some prefered vim, some swore by atom, and some were using RStudio, because "C is not _that_ different from R".
As ever, I had a strong opinion on the matter as well. Vim and emacs made me feal question my 
abilities to memorize many shortcuts and made my programming less efficient than it should have been. They are
great tools, and can work wonders, but there were some features of "more modern" text editors that I appreciated still.
On the other hand, editors like Atom made me feel like I was using a browser - good for watching porn, and wasting time,
but not too efficient for anything else. It would freeze when opening large projects, crash while updating, and cause more problems
than it solved. Sublime was a nice middle ground - it was lightning fast, and it had a plethora of plugins (provided you
installed package control) and code editing features that made my life easy enough. The only real problem with Sublime was
the initial setup time to get things where I want them.
