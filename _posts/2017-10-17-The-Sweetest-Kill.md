Ironically, I was listening to _Sweetest Kill_ by _Broken Social Scene_, while I found [today's xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1904/), and subsequently read the article on the [Great Boston Molases Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Molasses_Flood)

Apparently,
  _Molasses can be fermented to produce rum and ethanol, the active ingredient in other alcoholic beverages and a key component in the manufacturing of munitions._


I wonder if how many bottles of rum were produced and consume in order to solve this problem
