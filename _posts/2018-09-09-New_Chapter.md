This is it - school is over and tomorrow marks the first day of my working career.
It has been long coming and definitely did not end up according to plan (so far
nothing I have ever planned ended up working), but funnily enough, it ended up
even better. I'm immensely proud to say that I'll be joining Facebook AI's
video understanding team tomorrow, where I plan to continue to develop [my work]() on video
understanding in pursue of a doctorate degree. It has been a long journey, and I hope
to continue on in the right direction.
