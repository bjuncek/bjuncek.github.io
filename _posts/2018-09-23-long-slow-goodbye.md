For quite some time, I wanted to write something following Bourdain's suicide, but I never got to it.
Partially because I don't really think there is anything that I could write about that would add anything meaningful to
the debate, but mostly because he was sort of [a hero](https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2013/06/19) to me. In my mind he was an embodiment of everything good and bad in life - he made good decisions, he made bad ones; he talked about the hedonistic aspects of life as honestly, as he did about the nasty painful ones. He had dined at the best restaurants in the world, and still loved his In-and-Out, he took President Obama not in the equivalent of Per Se or Alinea, but to [the small shack in Vietnam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFuPB6DheRs). His shows felt real and some of them (like the [Croatian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5wv0QloiMs) one, or the [Seattle] one) sometimes even felt like he was channeling some of my experiences from those places.
It's a shame, we are only getting seven more weeks of it.

Thank you for everything you have left us with. You have viewed the world in a way most of us will never comprehend, but you made these remote places closer than they actually are.
