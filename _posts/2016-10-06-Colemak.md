Here is an thought - what if sitting and typing can cause one of the
most common workplace injuries in the current age?
Apparently, [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) is a real
thing once you're old enough.
Funny enough, I'm actually becoming old enough to consider the risks my future job will have,
on my body. So far, I realized that whatever I do, I'll include spending at least 5 hours
a day behind the keyboard. For the next 40 years (or until we come up with better
input sources). That's not a promising start, even if I'm used to common strain
injuries (wee "varsity" sports).

Now, I mostly enjoy programming - there is no need for me to find different career right?
Cool, so how to avoid strain injuries? And, of course, make my life just a little bit
harder.

Well, one thing is _keyboard_. And this is what this post will be about.
However, not the physical keyboard (on which I have written on my old blog), but
the actual _layout_. A lot of people, such as [Matt Mullenweg](ma.tt), and one of
my heroes, Nathan Myhrvold embraced Dvorak as a superior layout to the proven and
tested QWERTY. I have tried it in the past which caused ridicule and hatered of my
fellow roommates who never touched my computer again (and probably learned a couple
of Croatian swearwords).
It's not to say I was bad at it. After about three-four weeks, I was around 60-65wpm which
is close enough to my QWERTY speed, and certainly enough not to restrain me while
programming (I figured typing speed was never my real issue - thinking is). The
reason why I switched back to QWERTY though was mostly due to shortcuts. I tend to
use a plethora of shortcuts throughout all of the apps, and Dvorak was just not
suitable for that. It was actually noticably more comfortable to type, but every other
aspect of using a computer was way inferior to QWERTY.

ROI for dvorak just wasn't good enough. And I stuck with QWERTY for the last two years.

Until today that is.
While innocently browsing the web, I found [Colemak](colemak.com). It seems to solve
most to all of my shortcut problems, while also promising better learning curve.
It has also shown 2-3% improvement in efficiency over Dvorak, which itself was a
significant improvement over QWERTY.

So here is my challenge for this term:

__Everyhing I type in my room shall be typed on colemak. When I come to
35wpm, I'll switch completely.__.

Why? It's fun to learn new things. Is it going to be a pain, sure.
But if it'll also help me with my future help, power to it.
