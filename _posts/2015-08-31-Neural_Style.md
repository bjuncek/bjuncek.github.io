I have been interested in neural networks for a long time. In the recent couple of months, I have started to look more into
[convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), as I was growing more and more interested in doing research with the
[Visual Learning Group]http://vlg.cs.dartmouth.edu/vlg.html) here at Dartmouth. In the process, I have seen some amazing work and read some amazing papers.


Although I read more and more algorithms related papers, [this](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v1.pdf) application one seemed really cool.

And the best thing –  it was not written by computer scientists.
No authors were computer scientist by training, and I find that to be very inspirational: it means that tools such as neural networks became exactly that – tools.


Good job, and keep on with the cool stuff.
