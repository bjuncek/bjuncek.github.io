Today I found out that Americans don't know what [Cvarci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cvarci) (plural, "cvarak" singular) are. I thought it would be a shame not to share the beauty of what Wikipedia calls "pork crisps".

I personally like to think of them to be a balkan version of a deep-fried butter, except tastier. I've never been a big fan of them, however I find it amazing that in the country where deep-fried Mars bars are a thing, nobody thought of deep-frying lard.


Additional fun fact, while [butter has been used in polar expeditions](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11315994/Ten-things-no-one-tells-you-before-an-Antarctic-expedition.html) before, it seems like my friend Davor is going to try how suitable Cvarci are for the 
South Pole
